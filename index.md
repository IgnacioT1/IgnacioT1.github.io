### My Favorite Labs for CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, Is one of my favorites because it's the first introduction to programming and got me excited to see what the future would be like. This lab was the most simple as the only thing I had to do was to change Hello World to the names of my teammate and me. What we learned was the basics like the uses of std::cout and cin, return statements, and \n.
* Lab 4
    
    Lab 4 part 2, is also interesting because we had to write a program where we would get a secret number from player one then the second player would put in their guess. If the guess was wrong the screen would read out low or high and prompt the player to guess again. What we had to do for this lab was use int to store values and if, else if, and else statements to be able to get a secret number compare it to the guess and finally use the if statements to print out if t your guess was right or wrong
* Lab 6
   
    Lab 6 part 1, This lab is my favorite of the labs that we did. I have no idea why it just is for some reason. For this lab we had to use if statements, std::string and command_line.at and .size. The strings were used to hold the input for three variables. Command_line. at and .size were used to tell the program that we want there to be a minimum of arguments and where those elements are on the command line. The input would be something like ./sandwitch spam white mustard and the output would be Your order: A spam sandwich on white with mustard.
